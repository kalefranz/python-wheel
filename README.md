## Truly innocent little test

This is a sham PyPI package creation. In fact, it should be considered malicious. It was a naive
test that I thought would have never succeeded. Although, in fact, it did succeed.
For PyPA members: Please take note of what I just out-of-curiosity did here and consider guarding 
against like attacks. Also delete this package / dist-name.
